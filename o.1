.SH KNOWN BUGS
In some terminal emulators, scrolling quickly up or down with the arrow keys can make the text jump around (it works fine in \fBalacritty\fP). Scroll up and down with \fBctrl-n\fP and \fBctrl-p\fP instead to avoid this. Press \fBesc\fP to repaint the text, if needed.
.sp
Some unicode runes may disrupt the text flow. This is generally not a problem for editing code and configuration files, but may be an issue when editing files that contains text in many languages.
.sp
For some terminal emulators, if \fBo\fP is busy performing an operation, pressing \fBctrl-s\fP may lock the terminal. Some terminal emulators, like \fBkonsole\fP, can be configured to turn off this behavior. Press \fBctrl-q\fP to unlock the terminal again (together with the unfortunate risk of quitting \fBo\fP). You can also use the \fBctrl-o\fP menu for saving and quitting.
.sp
\fBo\fP may have issues with large files (of several MB+). For normal text files or source code files, this is a non-issue.
.sp
Middle-click pasting (instead of pasting with \fBctrl-v\fP) may have issues with only pasting the first character.
.sp
The smart indentation is not always smart.
